### Authentication System (OAuth & JWT)

This project focuses on building a secure authentication system using **OAuth** and **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for user verification and authorization.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Backend**: C# with .NET Core
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0, JWT
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server

**Project Highlights:**
- Implemented **OAuth 2.0** for secure third-party authentication.
- Utilized **JWT** for token-based authentication, ensuring secure and stateless user sessions across the application.
- Developed API endpoints in .NET Core for user registration, login, and token generation, with comprehensive error handling and validation.
- Integrated **Microsoft SQL Server** for secure storage of user data, including hashed passwords and OAuth tokens.
- Enhanced security by implementing best practices like token expiration, refresh tokens, and role-based access control (RBAC).
- Participated in code reviews and collaborated with team members to refine the authentication workflow and improve code quality.

This project provided in-depth experience with modern authentication techniques, focusing on security, scalability, and user experience.
